This program is a very simple paint program

While I can't say I won't update this in the future as I get better at coding, for now I am happy at where it is at so development is paused
For the future, I would like to add the ability to choose the name of the saved file, loading files, and the ability to draw text

To run: Download all files and then compile and execute PaintEngine.java

The current version can draw with the mouse or with shapes, change the background color, and save the drawing

To draw with a pen, simply click down with your mouse
To draw a shape, press 'p' on the keyboard which puts you in polygon mode
  In polygon mode, you click where you want the points of the polygon to be and then press enter to draw the shape
  To switch back to drawing mode, press the 'd' key
To change the color of the pen, either click inside one of the colors in the color pallet or press a number key corresponding to the colors: 1 is red and 9 is white
To change the color of the background, hold shift and click on the desired color
To clear the screen, press space bar, which will clear the screen
Pressing 's' will save the current drawing as "screenshot.jpg" in the same folder as the PaintEngine.java file
